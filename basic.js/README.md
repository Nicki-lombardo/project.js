HTML JavaScript

JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.

1. Metadata:

The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data)
The <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag
The <title> element is required and it defines the title of the document
The <style> element is used to define style information for a single document
The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets
The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings
The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts
The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page



The HTML <script> Tag
The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).

The <script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.

Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.

This JavaScript example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":

3. Layout:

HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page.

There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

- - > CSS framework
- - > CSS float property
- - > CSS flexbox
- - > CSS grid

<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
